This is a static repo for cross compiling riscv64 in a Gentoo container

As long as the client machine has this host as a target it should just work (tm). 

Uses image from "https://github.com/maquis196/gentoo-crossdev/"

To discover the values you need for the dockerfile, please run "crossdev-values.sh" on the client
